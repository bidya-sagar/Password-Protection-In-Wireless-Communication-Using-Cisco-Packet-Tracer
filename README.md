# Password-Protection-In-Wireless-Communication-Using-Cisco-Packet-Tracer

 In today's interconnected world, security of wireless communication is paramount. This study 
focuses on implementing password protection in wireless communication using Cisco Packet Tracer, 
a simulation tool widely used for network modeling. The primary objective is to enhance the security 
of wireless networks by implementing robust password authentication mechanisms.
 The study explores various authentication protocols supported by Cisco Packet Tracer, including 
WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access 2) and WPA3, and their effectiveness in securing wireless 
communication. Through practical simulations and analysis, the study evaluates the strengths and 
weaknesses of different password protection methods.
